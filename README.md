Restaurant page made for odin project

The webpage created uses webpack to bundle the javascript files and dynamically loads the content. The content is solely created through javascript. I use a pageLoader class that removed a lot of code from my first commit and modularized code that was repeated. Lots of google searching led to this. 

Below is a live demonstration of the website.
